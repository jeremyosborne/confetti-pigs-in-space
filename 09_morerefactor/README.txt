Purpose of this step
====================
* Code got too big, broke up into a real project structure.
* integrate with grunt with the intention of building a server side
  node.js server component, as well as to make building of the code
  more automatic.
* From here on, need to:
    npm install -g grunt
    grunt
  To build the code.
* Also, wanted more of a mixin approach to my classes, so changed up
  the SimpleClass constructor to the klass constructor to accommodate
  things.
