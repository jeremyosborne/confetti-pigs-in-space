# shootdown

WIP... upgrading to modern phaser ...WIP

Click and blow stuff up. Current version of code should be hosted on this project's github pages at http://jeremyosborne.github.io/shootdown.

This is more of my rubber duck hacking with [Phaser](http://phaser.io) and video game ideas than anything serious.


## Build the Game

* Get [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).
* `npm install`
* Run dev server: `npm start`
* go to: http://localhost:4242


## Playing the game

Click to shoot things. Such high scores. Much wow.
